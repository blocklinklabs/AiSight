# AiSight

## Overview

**AiSight** is an innovative medical application designed to assist healthcare providers in diagnosing eye conditions using artificial intelligence. By leveraging LLaMA 3 8B and Google Gemini models deployed on Theta Edge Cloud, AiSight provides accurate and swift tentative diagnoses based on user-provided images and medical history.

## Features

1. **Medical History Input:**

   - Users can select from a list of medical health complications to better understand the patient's health background.
   - Options include conditions such as Asthma, Sickle Cell, Hypertension, Diabetes, Ulcer, or None.

2. **Ocular History Input:**

   - Users can indicate any ocular health complications such as prior eye surgeries, ocular trauma, or if the patient wears spectacles.

3. **Symptom Input:**

   - Users can select from a list of symptoms the patient is experiencing, such as headache, tearing, redness, pain, itching, swelling, discharge, burning sensation, blurred vision, and light sensitivity.

4. **Image Upload:**

   - Users can upload photos of the patient's eyes to aid in diagnosis. The image can be taken directly using the camera or selected from the gallery.

5. **AI-Powered Diagnosis:**
   - The application uses AI models to provide a tentative diagnosis based on the symptoms and images provided.
   - Potential diagnoses include Allergic Conjunctivitis, Viral Conjunctivitis, and Bacterial Conjunctivitis, along with detailed symptoms and suggested ocular tests.

## Problem Statement
